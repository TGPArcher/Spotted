Have you ever wondered how to raiders manage to reach your colony unnoticed?
Well this mod fixes that by adding a chance for your colonists to spot them valuable time before they reach your colony.
But sometimes the raiders are more sneaky, to counter this a new long-range motion scanner has been added to the game which is increasing the chance to spot any raid.
So draft your colonists and wait for their arrival.
	
More details:
 * Motion Scanner requires tech "Long-range mineral scanner"
 * Every colonist increases discovery chance with 0.5%
 * Every motion scanner increases discovery chance with 20%
 * Discovery chance is adjusted with difficulty, higher difficulties requiring more scanners or colonists
